| Question                                                                 | Answer                                                                                       | Comment                                                                                                           |

| Is the data structured or unstructured?                                  | 20% structured → SQL<br>80% unstructured → discard SQL                                       | Sensor data like GPS is unstructured and may change schema with firmware updates                                 |
| Do we have existing data?                                                | Yes → Normalize and insert into table                                                        | Inform client this takes time; Fast option: Insert raw text; Also integrate recent weather data                  |
| Do we have more or less than 10k rows?                                   | More than 10k → Index relevant columns                                                       | No client approval needed; Example: 20k rows in 20 seconds from sensors                                           |
| Do we have *much more* than 10k rows?                                    | Distribute across multiple databases                                                         | Ask client: prioritize availability (patterns) or consistency (accurate decisions)                               |
| Does the app require transactions (ordering, registration, etc.)?        | Yes → Use SQL                                                                                 | For unstructured data, refactor and isolate transaction-related content into SQL                                 |
| Are there data or legal requirements?                                    | If yes, licensing matters                                                                    | Option 1: Open-source → We are accountable<br>Option 2: Commercial → Client is accountable                        |
| Priority: User experience or security?                                   | UX → Avoid encryption<br>Security → Encrypt columns                                           | Encrypted columns can't be queried; schema must be altered                                                       |
| Will the database be accessed by a large organization?                   | Yes → Set up access roles                                                                    | Role setup takes time; Skip for test data; DB admin can grant/revoke quickly                                     |
| Is the database read-only?                                               | Yes                                                                                          | Read-only tables can ignore CAP, optimize by separating read/write use cases                                     |
| How should the database be structured?                                   | By behavior<br>By business logic<br>By technical aspect                                       | These contradict; Full-stack engineer should integrate them                                                      |
| Is it a real-time application or dashboard?                              | Yes → Use column-based DB like ClickHouse                                                     | Availability > consistency; Inform the client                                                                    |
